# Recipe Manager Application - YumVerse

## Project Description

YumVerse is a responsive web application that allows users to easily manage and explore recipes. The application enables users to create and delete their own recipes, mark favorite recipes, and explore various preloaded recipes that can be sorted by cuisine type. It includes a responsive design that adjusts for both mobile and tablet layouts.

### Key Features

- **Add and Delete Recipes**: Users can create new recipes, including adding ingredients, steps, and photos (via URL). Recipes can be removed as needed.
- **Favorites**: Users can mark their favorite recipes, which will be highlighted in the "Favorites" section in both "Home" and "My Recipes" tabs for quick access.
- **Explore Cuisines**: Users can browse recipes by cuisine type, as well as checking the latest trends in recipes (random list generated from the predefined list).
- **Responsive Design**: The app automatically adjusts its layout to fit mobile and tablet screens, offering a sidebar navigation on tablets and a bottom navigation on mobile devices.
